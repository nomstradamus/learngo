# learngo

A simple tutorial for myself as I would like to refer to key concepts ( specially in concurrency ). 
Each directory has a single file with package main so that the tutorial is somple and one can easily build it 
by running go build
or
go build filename

One can experiment firther and I have added comments to explain what is being done.
